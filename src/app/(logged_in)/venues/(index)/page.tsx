                    <p>
                      Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and
                      typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                      industry&apos;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                      when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
                      scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived
                      not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                      typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
                      popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
                      sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently
                      with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
                      including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply
                      random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin
                      literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.
                      Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney
                      College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure
                      Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and
                      going through the cites of the word in classical
                      literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum
                      comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of de Finibus
                      Bonorum et Malorum (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by
                      Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the
                      theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The
                      first line of Lorem Ipsum, Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..,
                      comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

                    <p>
                      The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is
                      reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32
                      and 1.10.33 from de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum by Cicero
                      are also reproduced in their exact original form,
                      accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation
                      by H. Rackham.
